# Welcome to CS50!

Hey there 👋🏾, this repository contains the code examples and snippets in the cs50 live lectures. I ensured I coded and practiced along side Mark! 

It also contains tutorials and tried on my own, just to understand the language used. 

This is majorly what this repository is all about!
