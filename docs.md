## Concepts

#### Conditionals
- Syntax -->  `if *condition*: *action*`
- else if in python is `elif`
- `||` and `&&` operators are written as `or` and `and` respectively


## Did you know?

#### Using the print function
- You can use interpolation by including an f at the beginning of the print function's input and use curly braces to concatenate variables e.g `print(f"Hello, {variable}")`

#### Others
- You can't use `++` to increment in python like in Javascript or C
