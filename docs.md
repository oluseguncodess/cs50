# My documentations 
This contains essential resources that help me code along

## Resources

#### Official Documentation for python!
[Python Docs](docs.python.org)

#### How to install the cs50 library for python
* Setting up python in VS Code and creating virtual environment --> [Getting Started with Python in VS Code (Official Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2cwvpJSBX4)

* use `pip install cs50` in the terminal to download the cs50 library. 
*You have to create a virtual environment first! And ensure you create it in a new terminal*

## Concepts

#### Conditionals
- Syntax -->  `if *condition*: *action*`
- else if in python is `elif`
- `||` and `&&` operators are written as `or` and `and` respectively

#### Loops
- You can loop through several ways like using a while loop, a list or the range function in python.

#### Functions
- You can create your own function by using the keyword `def` and the name of your function and then define the code(action) you want your function to carry out. 
- You have to define your own function in a `main()`function so hoisting can work. Just ensure you called the main function at the end.

#### Dictonaries
These are objects. They have key value pairs

## Did you know?

#### Using the print function
- You can use interpolation by including an f at the beginning of the print function's input and use curly braces to concatenate variables e.g `print(f"Hello, {variable}")`

- Loops can use else keyword

#### Reasons why Javascript rocks  ðŸŽ¸
- You can't use `++` to increment in python like in Javascript or C
- Python doesn't have a do while loop. you can however use a while loop and a break statement to implement one in python
